# Landing Page Project

## Table of Contents

- I loop of sections by forEach and create (li, a) then appended them to fragment then to menu-list (built dynamically)

- I use (IntersectionObserver API) on each section in viewport and change section and link active state

- I use (scrollTo) to smooth-scroll to the appropriate section. when clicking an item from the navigation menu

- I use (setTimeout) to Hide fixed navigation bar while not scrolling or mousemove out 400px from the top

- finally I added a scroll to top element on the page thatâ€™s only visible when the user scrolls below the fold of the page (250px).
